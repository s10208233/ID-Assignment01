## Design Process
Kygo creates music under the 'EDM' and wave/beach house genre, *'EDM' also known as electronic dance music*, the ambience of his live shows and the mood of his songs generally falls similar to a mood of disco lights or beach vibes. As mentioned in the introduction, this website is designed for Kygo's audience who wishes to follow up news of kygo, listen to his music/album on the website and external platforms such as Spotify via iframes or through external links, book up coming live shows, redirect users/audience interested in Kygo's merchandise to his store, watch music videos or recorded performances and to contact kygo through an email address link or to keep in contact by following through email subscription. New users are also able to learn more about Kygo and his work through this site.

**Exaple Scenario**
>  1. New listener named Bob hears song playing and got to know just the name **"Kygo"**.<br>
>  2. Bob searches google for "Kygo" and finds this site.<br>
>  3. Now Bob can listen to more Kygo's work and keep up with him through this site or the other platforms this site links to. Now Bob knows about kygo and his work.<br>

## Features
#### Navigation Bar
At the very top of the page or its header, the navigation bar is universal and applies to every page with intended purpose and the main way for the user to navigate through the site.

#### Footer
Similarly to the header, the footer is universal and applies to every page. The footer provides the same navigation but in a more subtle manner, inteded so that the user does not need to scroll back up to navigate the page once they are done browsing that particular page. In addition, Social or Social Media links can be found here.

### Existing Features
- Mobile navigation: Upon going below 850px screen size the desktop navigation bar gets hidden and only shown when the hamburger icon is active.

### Features Left to Implement
- Possible features to implement: Parallax scrolling with JavaScript for aesthetic.

## Technologies Used

In every page, for the mobile view *(or if the screen is smaller than 850px)* the navigation bar's hamburger icon works by using JavaScript to hide and show certain elements following the media screen size. Making the navigation more compact for smaller screen sizes and more user friendly.

- [JavaScript - W3Schools.com | Mobile Navigation](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_mobile_navbar.asp)
    - The project uses **JavaScript** to hide and show certain elements needed for the mobile view's navigation. Referenced from link above.
